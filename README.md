# linn-channel-core

This project provides all the core classes for an integration between between an eCommerce marketplace and [Linnworks.net](https://www.linnworks.net) using Rigidas hosting.

The sample marketplace used for testing this project is the Create.net marketplace ([API Documentation](http://developers.create.net/API-Documentation)) with the integration project ([linn-channel-create](https://github.com/RigidasSoftware/linn-channel-create))

The classes within are fully tested and any changes must be submitted with tests.
